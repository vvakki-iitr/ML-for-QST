# AI Usage

I used an AI assistant (Google DeepMind) to help with this project.

## How it helped:
*   **Planning**: It suggested using the "Cholesky decomposition" method to make sure the output is a valid quantum state.
*   **Coding**: It wrote the starting code for the Transformer model and training loop.
*   **Docs**: It drafted the explanations, which I then edited.

## Did I check the work?
Yes.
*   I checked the math logic myself.
*   I ran the code on small examples to test it.
*   I watched the training results to make sure it was actually learning.

## Questions I asked:
*   "How do I ensure the output is a valid density matrix?"
*   "Write a PyTorch Dataset for Pauli measurements."
